# PHYS227 HW 7

**Author:** Michael Seaman

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-7-seama107.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-7-seama107)

**Due date:** 2016/04/05

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise 7.8 (```Lagrange_poly3.py```) *Hint:* Liberally reuse the exercises from HW2 to save yourself work.
1. Exercise 7.9 (```Lagrange_poly4.py```) 
1. Exercise 7.27 (```Polynomial_vec.py```). *Note:* Code and use the implementation in Section 7.3.7, including the test function.  Make sure you understand how everything works before introducing the modifications indicated by the exercise. Demonstrate the speed-up in your Jupyter notebook, and explain why it is faster.
1. Exercise 7.28 (```Polynomial_dict.py```) Explain the pros and cons of this modification vs. that of exercise 7.27.

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw7.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

This assignment was probably one of my favorite so far - I enjoy thinking about how to apply the tricks I already knew about polynomials and trying to get numpy to agree with them. The time comparisons were fun too, but the results were disapointing...

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
